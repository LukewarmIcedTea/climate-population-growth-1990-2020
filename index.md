This project examines whether climate—specifically average temperature—is related to population growth, using data from eight countries between 1990 and 2020.

<h2>Methods and Results</h2>

This section presents the main analytical steps and results. Interactive figures are embedded below.

This interactive figure compares annual population change with annual temperature for each country from 1990–2020. Temperature is shown as the annual mean, with a band indicating the yearly min–max range of monthly temperatures. Population change varies substantially year to year, while temperature varies within a relatively narrow range. Across countries, spikes or dips in population change do not consistently align with unusually warm or cool years, suggesting a weak short-run within-country relationship.
